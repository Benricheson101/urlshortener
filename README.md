## Running for Yourself
1. Create a secrets for generating API keys. The OpenSSL CLI works well for this (`openssl rand -hex 64`), but any 64 character long string should work.

2. Deploy this repo to your Cloudflare Worker account using the wrangler CLI

3. Add your secret as an application variable called `JWT_SECRET` for your worker

4. Generate an API key (MacOS/Linux only. Windows users can run this with WSL :P) `URL_SHORTENER_JWT_SECRET="<your-secret>"./scripts/urlshortener create-token <username>`. The username doesn't do anything other than show who created the shortlink if you look up a link with the CLI or API (outlined above)
